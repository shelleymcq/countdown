# Playground for random React challenges.

## Challenge 1

Create a React component that displays a countdown timer. The timer should start at 60 seconds and count down by one second until it reaches zero. Once the timer reaches zero, display a message saying "Time's up!".

## Challenge 2

Create a circular progress 'bar' with just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
